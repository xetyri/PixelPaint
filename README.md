# PixelPaint

This is my pet-project, I practick knowledge js. I learn Js DOM and I wanted made the mosaics element, where color changes when user click many times for one div. Now I make color bocks for them chenges and add "buttons" for clear color, for reload paint-screen, for save and download paint-screen in jpg.
